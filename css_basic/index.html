            <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
            
            <p>Hello! I'm excited to share my journey into web development with you. This portfolio represents my first steps in learning HTML and creating websites from scratch. Web development has always fascinated me, and now I'm finally taking the plunge to learn it properly.</p>
            
            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            
            <p>This website is built using pure HTML, following W3C standards and best practices. I'm learning to structure content semantically, use proper headings, and create accessible web pages. Every element you see here has been hand-coded without relying on frameworks or libraries.</p>
            
            <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
            
            <p>Through this project, I aim to master the fundamentals of web development. I want to understand how HTML works at its core, how to write clean and valid code, and how to create web pages that are both functional and accessible. These skills will form the foundation for everything I build in the future.</p>
            
            <p>I'm committed to writing code that validates with W3C standards and follows industry best practices. This means paying attention to details like proper document structure, semantic HTML elements, and ensuring every file ends with a newline character. Small details matter in creating professional, maintainable code.</p>
